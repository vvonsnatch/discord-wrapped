# Discord Wrapped
Analyzing discord server activity using the Discord API (Channel Resource) and pandas, nltk, etc

The vision: Starting with a Jupyter notebook, aggregating discord activity in a specific server in all of 2022,
tokenizing the messages and analyzing the text (such as performing a sentiment analysis) using nltk.
